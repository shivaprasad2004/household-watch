1. The system will guide you through calibration:
2. Turn off all appliances in your home
3. Confirm the baseline reading is near zero
4. Turn on a known appliance (like a 100W light bulb)
5. Verify the reading matches expected consumption
6. Complete the calibration process

## Verification
### Check Everything is Working
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for initial data to appear
2. Check the dashboard for real-time energy usage
3. Turn on an appliance and watch the usage change
4. Verify notifications are working (if configured)

### Common Setup Issues
